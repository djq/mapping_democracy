# Public Transport and Accessiblity in Dublin #

Summary: Using the location of public transport stops (Bus, Dart, Luas and Train) I explore how where the nearest stop is for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA). I do this my examining the distance need to travel from a 250m grid to the nearest stop, and also provide a user-centered tool to enable you to explore this in your area. Through this approach I generate a surface of accessibility using this basic calculation. This approach does not consider how far you can travel; it only identifies the nearest stops. In the next iteration of this I will explore how far you can travel using public transport modes (and compare this to other transport modes).
